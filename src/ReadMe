STEPS TO OPEN AND RUN THE PROGRAM with Database

1. Find folder in which the THON project is located
2. Open THON folder, and then open ".netbeans-derby" folder
3. Copy files from this “.neatbeans-derby” folder (this is the THON database with user credentials)
4. Search in your User folder for ".netbeans-derby" folder
5. Paste folder in this folder the the files you copied from the THON folder — aka ".netbeans-derby" files

Now that the database is locally in your system. It is time to set up the local database with Netbeans:

6. Open Netbeans
7. On Netbeans top menu, go to Window > Services (which will open the Services tab, next to your Projects tab, typically on the left)
8. Click on + sign next to Databases and right-click on Java DB. Click Properties
9. You will "Database Location" underneath "Java DB Installation". Make sure that the "Database Location" is YOUR system's ".netbeans-derby" folder.
10. ALSO, make sure "Java DB Installation" is located in YOUR system's Java folder. The path should end with "db"
11. Press OK to close
12. Right-click on Java DB and click "Start Server". Right Click on THON and click "Connect".
13. The prompt will ask you for the THON database's username and password ("thon" and "123" - don't put those quotes). Enter those credentials. THERE SHOULD NOT BE AN ERROR.
14. The prompt should close and the "Output" window on the bottom should return two statements (put screenshot)
15. Return to "Projects" tab, click on the "THON" java application and Run it.
16. The usernames and passwords from THON database are in the "Output" folder for testing use. Choose any to enter into the LoginUIv2 window
